title: The longer-term goals of the Open Science Workshops project
---

Some specific things we want to see:

 * __Executable papers__ - The idea that any paper can be obtained, the entire
    source material being handy, and then any change anyone likes can be made
    to it.
 
 * __All of scientific knowledge available and organised__ - Simply,
    everything we discover as humans should be organised and available for
    querying and review by everyone, for free.

 * __Extension of the amount of knowledge we can obtain through programming__ - It's
    [becoming clear](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/reinventing-discovery/) that it is possible to directly affect how much we can
    discover (in the positive direction), as humans, by using tools to aid us.
    We want to help explore this ability as far as possible.
