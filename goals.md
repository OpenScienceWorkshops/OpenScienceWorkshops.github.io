title: The longer-term goals of the Open Science Workshops project
---

Some specific things we want to see:

 * __Executable papers__ - The idea that any paper can be obtained, the entire
    source material being handy, and then any change anyone likes can be made
    to it.
 
 * __All of scientific knowledge available and organised__ - Simply,
    everything we discover as humans should be organised and available for
    querying and review by everyone, for free.
