We are excited to announce the first Open Science Workshop, being held at
Inspire9 in Richmond, on the 19th of July, 2014. The workshop aims to teach
“open science” techniques to the science community: specifically, tools to
collaborate on code, documents and data, collaborative computation
environments, and why one should do this, and what is available.

This workshop will be completely free to attend. The event is being run by a
team of volunteers interested in helping the scientific community adopt open
science!

## What is Open Science (and why should I care)?

Open science strives to make innovation in science and technology accessible
to everyone. By using open tools that enable collaboration, learning,
reproducibility and application the scientific and greater community will
benefit immensely. In particular it encourages collaboration between
scientists, and advocates the ideas of open access to research.

## About
A full-day workshop that will teach the usage of basic tools for open collaboration, with a specific view to collaborating on scientific projects (papers and code).

**Website**:
[http://openscienceworkshops.github.io/](http://openscienceworkshops.github.io)


## Audience
The workshop is aimed at researchers, lecturers, professionals and students in
scientific fields. If you’re a scientist that deals with code, either
sometimes or often, but “source control” is something mysterious you keep
hearing about, this is for you. 

You should also come along if you are at all interested in learning what open
science is about, and work in or near a scientific field. 

**You will need**: a laptop with permissions to install software on it. That’s it - no background necessary.

## Dates/Location

**Date/Time**:  9:00am - 6:30pm, Saturday 19th of July, 2014 
**Location**: Inspire9, Level 1/41 Stewart Street, Richmond.

## Agenda
*Morning* - Sharing and collaborating on code and data publicly (source control)
*Afternoon* - Collaborative computation environments

**Full details**: [Agenda](https://github.com/OpenScienceWorkshops/osw-material/wiki/Agenda-for-1-day-workshop)

We are also encouraging the participation of people working on open science
projects. If you are working on any software/websites that are useful to
scientists please come along on the day and work on your project, and tell us
about it at the end of the day!

Lunch will be provided.
