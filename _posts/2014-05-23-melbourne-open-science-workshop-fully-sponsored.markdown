Less than a week after the idea for this workshop was conceived, I'm very
excited to say that the first Open Science Workshop in Melbourne has received
all the necessary funding to go ahead!

A big thanks to the following organisations who have provided support:

  - [Inspire9](http://inspire9.com)
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  - [Biarri Networks](http://www.biarrinetworks.com/)

Full details of the sponsorship we have received can be found in the Google
Doc [Sponsors/Expenses for OSW Melbourne
2014](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/155HuEip_dED27Y29AhqoSP_3clLEjP1pMTN4wbn_i_s/edit?usp=sharing).

Looking forward to seeing you all in July!
