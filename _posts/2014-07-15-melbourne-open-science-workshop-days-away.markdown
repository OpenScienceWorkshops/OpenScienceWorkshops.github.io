Well, I'm just super excited to note that we are just a few days away from the
event and have almost sold out of the ambitious number of tickets we
originally set! I'm pretty blown away by the interest in this area, and the
number of active projects that I've discovered since starting this one! You'll
hear more about this on the day!

We've also received stickers from GitHub! So make sure you arrive on time
(9:30am for a 10:00am-sharp start) to get the coolest ones!

Further, we've got an excellent speaker in [Alex
Ghitza](http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/~aghitza/) who will be opening the day
with a talk motivating the ideas of open science and reproducible research
from a pure mathematics background.

The
[Agenda](https://github.com/OpenScienceWorkshops/osw-material/wiki/Agenda-for-1-day-workshop)
has been updated with a finer breakdown of how the day will look, as well as a
Google calendar of the day (find it on the [homepage](/)), and a even a [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c4qjegb51p308nlk62di2eg88hg) that
you can confirm your attendence to, if you're into that kind of thing.

I can't wait to meet everyone and talk to heaps of people about
cool open science things! 

See you on Saturday!
