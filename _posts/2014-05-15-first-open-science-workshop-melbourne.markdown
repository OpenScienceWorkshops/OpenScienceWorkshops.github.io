So we are launching the *first* Open Science Workshop in Melbourne, Australia.

The idea is to gather together scientists and researchers from all fields, and
talk about the tools and techniques that the open source community has made
available to aid in collaboration and just generally working more effectively!

The workshop will be about helping everyone use these tools. *No familiarity*
with the tools themselves, or even the concepts, will be necessary in order to
attend.

For this workshop, we will be focusing on two concepts:

  * sharing and collaborating on code and data publically (source control), and
  * collaborative computational environments.

For the first item, we will be using [GitHub](https://github.com), and for the
second, the [SageMathCloud](http://sagemathcloud.com).
