## Idea

So we are launching the *first* Open Science Workshop in Melbourne, Australia.

The idea is to gather together scientists and researchers from all fields, and
talk about the tools and techniques that the open source community has made
available to aid in collaboration and just generally working more effectively!


## Audience

The workshop will be about helping _everyone_ use these tools. *No familiarity*
with the tools themselves, or even the concepts, will be necessary in order to
attend.

You should come along if you are at all interested in learning what _open
science_ is about, and work in or near a scientific field.

For the workshop itself, a laptop will be required, and you will need to have
permission to install software on it. Everything else will be taken care of.

There will be a side-track for people working on open science programs to come
along and hack on them together; with a brief presentation on your work at the
end of the day.


## Agenda

For this workshop, we will be focusing on two concepts:

  * sharing and collaborating on code and data publically (source control), and
  * collaborative computational environments.

For the first item, we will be using [GitHub](https://github.com), and for the
second, the [SageMathCloud](http://sagemathcloud.com).

A description of the day itself can be found here: [Agenda for OSW
Melb](https://github.com/OpenScienceWorkshops/osw-material/wiki/Agenda-for-1-day-workshop).
